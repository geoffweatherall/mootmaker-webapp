/**
 * Creates a confirmed, working test account WITHOUT going through the real code-entry UI -
 * `AdminConfirmSignUp` confirms a sign-up with no code at all (see
 * mootmaker/docs/reference/testing-strategy.md#reading-cognitos-emails-in-tests's "Bypassing the code
 * requirement entirely"). Use this for anything that needs a working signed-up account as a
 * *precondition* rather than as the thing actually under test - e.g. forgot-password's own test
 * needs an existing account before it can test resetting that account's password; it is not
 * itself testing that sign-up works (sign-up's own test already covers that, through the real UI
 * with a real emailed code).
 *
 * Still a completely real Cognito account in the deployed pool - AdminConfirmSignUp fires the
 * same PostConfirmation trigger a real code-confirmed sign-up would (creating the linked Person,
 * setting the default class), so anything reading the account back (e.g. signing in through the
 * real UI afterward) sees a normal, fully-set-up account.
