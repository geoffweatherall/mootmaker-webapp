#
# NOTE: this is DESTRUCTIVE and IRREVERSIBLE. Terraform prompts for interactive confirmation
# before deleting anything; this script intentionally does not pass -auto-approve by default.
#
# --yes passes -auto-approve, for automation that has no stdin to answer the prompt with (the
# release pipeline's ephemeral acceptance environments, and the scheduled ephemeral sweep - see
# mootmaker/designs/ci-cd-pipeline.md Rollout steps 6 and 11).
#
# Non-interactive mode is deliberately NARROWER than interactive mode, not just quieter. Run by
# hand, this script will destroy "production" if you confirm the prompt - the prompt is the
# safeguard. With --yes there is no prompt, so "production" and "test" are refused outright
# instead: those two change through the release pipeline (Decision 6), never through an
# unattended undeploy.
